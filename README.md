Create a function named calculate_discount(price, discount_percent) that calculates the final price after applying a discount. The function should take the original price (price) and the discount percentage (discount_percent) as parameters. If the discount is 20% or higher, apply the discount; otherwise, return the original price.
Using the calculate_discount function, prompt the user to enter the original price of an item and the discount percentage. Print the final price after applying the discount, or if no discount was applied, print the original price.

calculate_discount(price, discount_percent):
    """
    Calculate the final price after applying a discount if the discount is 20% or higher.
    
    Parameters:
    price (float): The original price of the item.
    discount_percent (float): The discount percentage.
    
    Returns:
    float: The final price after applying the discount, or the original price if the discount is less than 20%.

    if discount_percent >= 20:
        discount_amount = (discount_percent / 100) * price
        final_price = price - discount_amount
        return final_price
    else:
        return price

# Calculate and print the final price

if final_price < original_price:
    print(f"The final price after applying the discount is: ${final_price:.2f}")
else:
    print(f"No discount applied. The original price is: ${original_price:.2f}")
